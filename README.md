**Plasma Canopy** is a volumetric LED art piece that is due to debut at Burning Seed 2019 with [Telekinetik Chair Repair](https://telekinetik.org). Three-dimensional dynamic content synchronises to music to create an immersive space for people to enjoy shared experiences.

The lighting hardware features approximately 150 diffuse LED tubes that provide a 360 degree field of view, that are waterproofed, exposed to the elements and clearly visible from a distance.

This repository provides a fully fledged simulation instance for developers to contribute patterns and content that will be utilised at Burning Seed 2019 and recycled at future festivals and events.

It runs in Processing using the [LX Studio](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio) framework. The system may be controlled directly, or via remote OSC devices. Real-time spatial audio metering and position data can also be used to control animation. You may find the [LXStudio API](http://lx.studio/api/) of use when developing patterns.

## Installation

First, download and install [Processing 3 &rarr;](https://processing.org/download/?processing)

Make a clone of the repository in your Processing sketchbook folder.

```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/solarleroy/PlasmaCanopySimulation.git
$ cd PlasmaCanopySimulation
$ git checkout -b <name_of_your_branch>
$ open PlasmaCanopySimulation.pde
```

Code something awesome with using the existing patterns as a template! Feel free to reach out to Leroy for any questions and pointers at leroyck@me.com. We look forward to seeing what you come up with!
